# Introduction

QUIC {{?QUIC=I-D.ietf-quic-transport}} is a new transport protocol currently
under development in the IETF quic working group, focusing on support of
semantics as needed for HTTP/2 {{?QUIC-HTTP=I-D.ietf-quic-http}}. Based on
current deployment practices, QUIC is encapsulated in UDP and encrypted by
default. The current version of QUIC integrates TLS
{{?QUIC-TLS=I-D.ietf-quic-tls}} to encrypt all payload data and most control
information. Given QUIC is an end-to-end transport protocol, all information in
the protocol header, even that which can be inspected, is is not meant to be
mutable by the network, and will therefore be integrity-protected to the extent
possible.

This document provides guidance for network operation on the management of QUIC
traffic. This includes guidance on how to interpret and utilize information that
is exposed by QUIC to the network as well as explaining requirement and
assumptions that the QUIC protocol design takes toward the expected network
treatment. It also discusses how common network management practices will be
impacted by QUIC.

Of course, network management is not a one-size-fits-all endeavour: practices
considered necessary or even mandatory within enterprise networks with certain
compliance requirements, for example, would be impermissible on other networks
without those requirements. This document therefore does not make any specific
recommendations as to which practices should or should not be applied; for each
practice, it describes what is and is not possible with the QUIC transport
protocol as defined.

QUIC is at the moment very much a moving target. This document refers the state
of the QUIC working group drafts as well as to changes under discussion, via
issues and pull requests in GitHub current as of the time of writing.

## Notational Conventions

The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are used in this document.
It's not shouting; when these words are capitalized, they have a special meaning
as defined in {{!RFC2119}}.

# Features of the QUIC Wire Image {#sec-wire-image}

In this section, we discusses those aspects of the QUIC transport protocol that
have an impact on the design and operation of devices that forward QUIC packets.
Here, we are concerned primarily with QUIC's unencrypted wire image, which we
define as the information available in the packet header in each QUIC packet,
and the dynamics of that information. Since QUIC is a versioned protocol, also
the wire image of the header format can change. However, at least the mechanism
by which a receiver can determine which version is used and the meaning and
location of fields used in the version negotiation process need to be fixed.

This document is focused on the protocol as presently defined in
{{?QUIC}} and {{?QUIC-TLS}}, and will change to track
those documents.

## QUIC Packet Header Structure {#public-header}

The QUIC packet header is under active development; see section 5 of {{?QUIC}}
for the present header structure.

The first bit of the QUIC header indicates the presence of a long header that
exposes more information than the short header. The long header is used during
connection establishment, including version negotiation, server retry, and
0-RTT data while the short header is used after the handshake and therefore on
most data packets. The fields and location of these fields in the QUIC long
header are invariant for future versions of QUIC, although  future versions of
QUIC may provide additional fields in the long header.. In the current version
of QUIC the long header is fixed-length, containing a header Type, a 64-bit
Connection ID, a 32-bit Packet Number, and a 32-bit Version. The short header
is variable length, where the bits after the Header Form bit indicate the
presence of the Connection ID, and the length of the packet number.

The following information may be exposed in the packet header:

- header type: the long header has a 7-bit packet type field following the
Header Form bit. The current version of QUIC defines five packet types, namely
Version Negotiation, Initial, Retry, Handshake, 0-RTT Protected.

- connection ID: The connection ID is always present on the long and optionally
present on the short header indicated by the Connection ID Flag. If present at
the short header it at the same position then for the long header. The position
and length pf the congestion ID itself as well as the Connection ID flag in the
short header is fixed for all versions of QUIC. The connection ID identifies the
connection associated with a QUIC packet, for load-balancing and NAT rebinding
purposes; see {{sec-loadbalancing}} and {{rebinding}}. Therefore it is also
expected that the Connection ID will either be present on all packets of a flow
or none of the short header packets. However, this field is under endpoint
control and there is no protocol mechanism that hinders the sending endpoint to
revise its decision about exposing the Connection ID at any time during the
connection.

- packet number: Every packet has an associated packet number. The packet number
increases with each packet, and the least-significant bits of the packet number
are present on each packet. In the short header the length of the exposed packet
number field is defined by the (short) header type and can either be 8, 16, or
32 bits. See {{packetnumber}}.

- version number: The version number is present on the long headers and
identifies the version used for that packet, expect for the Version negotiation
packet. The version negotiation packet is fixed for all version of QUIC and
contains a list of versions that is supported by the sender. The version in the
version field of the Version Negotiation packet is the reflected version of the
Initial packet and is therefore explicitly not supported by the sender.

- key phase: The Key Phase bit identifies the key used to encrypt the packet.

## Integrity Protection of the Wire Image {#wire-integrity}

As soon as the cryptographic context is established, all information in the QUIC
header, including those exposed in the packet header, is integrity protected.
Further, information that were sent and exposed in previous packets when the
cryptographic context was established yet, e.g. for the cryptographic initial
handshake itself, will be validated later during the cryptographic handshake,
such as the version number.  Therefore, devices on path MUST NOT change any
information or bits in QUIC packet headers. As alteration of header information
would cause packet drop due to a failed integrity check at the receiver, or can
even lead to connection termination.

## Connection ID and Rebinding {#rebinding}

The connection ID in the QUIC packer header is used to allow routing of QUIC
packets at load balancers on other than five-tuple information, ensuring that
related flows are appropriately balanced together; and to allow rebinding of a
connection after one of the endpoint's addresses changes - usually the client's,
in the case of the HTTP binding. The client set a Connection ID in the Initial
Client packet that will be used during the handshake. A new connection ID is
then provided by the server during connection establishment, that will be used
in the short header after the handshake. Further a server might provide
additional connection IDs that can the used by the client at any time during the
connection. Therefore if a flow changes one of its IP addresses it may keep the
same connection ID, or the connection ID may also change together with the IP
address migration, avoiding linkability; see Section 7.6 of {{?QUIC}}.

## Packet Numbers {#packetnumber}

The packet number field is always present in the QUIC packet header. The packet
number exposes the least significant 32, 16, or 8 bits of an internal packet
counter per flow direction that increments with each packet sent. This packet
counter is initialized with a random 31-bit initial value at the start of a
connection.

Unlike TCP sequence numbers, this packet number increases with every packet,
including those containing only acknowledgment or other control information.
Indeed, whether a packet contains user data or only control information is
intentionally left unexposed to the network. The packet number increases with
every packet but they sender may skip packet numbers.

While loss detection in QUIC is based on packet numbers, congestion control by
default provides richer information than vanilla TCP does. Especially, QUIC does
not rely on duplicated ACKs, making it more tolerant of packet re-ordering.

## Initial Handshake and PMTUD

\[Editor's note: text needed.]

## Version Negotiation and Greasing

Version negotiation is not protected, given the used protection mechanism can
change with the version.  However, the choices provided in the list of version
in the Version Negotiation packet will be validated as soon as the cryptographic
context has been established. Therefore any manipulation of this list will be
detected and will cause the endpoints to terminate the connection.

Also note that the list of versions in the Version Negotiation packet may
contain reserved versions. This mechanism is used to avoid ossification in the
implementation on the selection mechanism. Further, a client may send a Initial
Client packet with a reserved version number to trigger version negotiation. In
the Version Negotiation packet the connection ID and packet number of the Client
Initial packet are reflected to provide a proof of return-routability. Therefore
changing these information will also cause the connection to fail.

# Network-visible information about QUIC flows

This section addresses the different kinds of observations and inferences that
can be made about QUIC flows by a passive observer in the network based on the
wire image in {{sec-wire-image}}. Here we assume a bidirectional observer (one
that can see packets in both directions in the sequence in which they are
carried on the wire) unless noted.

## Identifying QUIC traffic {#sec-identifying}

The QUIC wire image is not specifically designed to be distinguishable from
other UDP traffic.

The only application binding currently defined for QUIC is HTTP
{{?QUIC-HTTP}}. HTTP over QUIC uses UDP port 443 by default,
although URLs referring to resources available over HTTP over QUIC may specify
alternate port numbers. Simple assumptions about whether a given flow is using
QUIC based upon a UDP port number may therefore not hold; see also {{?RFC7605}}
section 5.

### Identifying Negotiated Version

An in-network observer assuming that a set of packets belongs to a QUIC flow
can infer the version number in use by observing the handshake: an Initial
packet with a given version from a client to which a server responds with an
Initial packet with the same version implies acceptance of that version.

Negotiated version cannot be identified for flows for which a handshake is not
observed, such as in the case of NAT rebinding; however, these flows can be
associated with flows for which a version has been identified; see
{{sec-flow-association}}.

In the rest of this section, we discuss only packets belonging to Version 1 QUIC
flows, and assume that these packets have been identified as such through the
observation of a version negotiation.

### Rejection of Garbage Traffic {#sec-garbage}

A related question is whether a first packet of a given flow on known
QUIC-associated port is a valid QUIC packet, in order to support in-network
filtering of garbage UDP packets (reflection attacks, random backscatter). While
heuristics based on the first byte of the packet (packet type) could be used to
separate valid from invalid first packet types, the deployment of such
heuristics is not recommended, as packet types may have different meanings in
future versions of the protocol.

## Connection confirmation {#sec-confirm}

Connection establishment uses Initial, Handshake, and Retry packets containing
a TLS handshake on Stream 0. Connection establishment can therefore be
detected using heuristics similar to those used to detect TLS over TCP. A
client using 0-RTT connection may also send data packets in 0-RTT Protected
packets directly after the Initial packet containing the TLS Client Hello.
Since these packets may be reordered in the network, note that 0-RTT Protected
data packets may be seen before the Initial packet. Note that only clients
send Initial packets, so the sides of a connection can be distinguished by
QUIC packet type in the handshake.

## Application Identification {#sec-server}

The cleartext TLS handshake may contain Server Name Indication (SNI)
{{?RFC6066}}, by which the client reveals the name of the server it intends to
connect to, in order to allow the server to present a certificate based on
that name. It may also contain information from Application-Layer Protocol
Negotiation (ALPN) {{?RFC7301}}, by which the client exposes the names of
application-layer protocols it supports; an observer can deduce that one of
those protocols will be used if the connection continues.

Work is currently underway in the TLS working group to encrypt the SNI in TLS
1.3 {{?TLS-ENCRYPT-SNI=I-D.ietf-tls-sni-encryption}}, reducing the information
available in the SNI to the name of a fronting service, which can generally be
identified by the IP address of the server anyway. If used with QUIC, this
would make SNI-based application identification impossible through passive
measurement.

## Flow association {#sec-flow-association}

The QUIC Connection ID (see {{rebinding}}) is designed to allow an on-path
device such as a load-balancer to associate two flows as identified by
five-tuple when the address and port of one of the endpoints changes; e.g. due
to NAT rebinding or server IP address migration. An observer keeping flow state
can associate a connection ID with a given flow, and can associate a known flow
with a new flow when when observing a packet sharing a connection ID and one
endpoint address (IP address and port) with the known flow.

The connection ID to be used for a long-running flow is chosen by the server
(see {{?QUIC}} section 5.6) during the handshake. This value should be treated
as opaque; see {{sec-loadbalancing}} for caveats regarding connection ID
selection at servers.

## Flow teardown {#sec-teardown}

The QUIC does not expose the end of a connection; the only indication to on-path
devices that a flow has ended is that packets are no longer observed. Stateful
devices on path such as NATs and firewalls must therefore use idle timeouts to
determine when to drop state for QUIC flows.

Changes to this behavior are currently under discussion:  see
https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/602.

## Round-trip time measurement {#sec-rtt}

Round-trip time of QUIC flows can be inferred by observation once per flow,
during the handshake, as in passive TCP measurement; this requires parsing of
the QUIC packet header and the cleartext TLS handshake on stream 0.

In the common case, the delay between the Initial packet containing the TLS
Client Hello and the Handshake packet containing the TLS Server Hello
represents the RTT component on the path between the observer and the server.
The delay between the TLS Server Hello and the Handshake packet containing the
TLS Finished message sent by the client represents the RTT component on the
path between the observer and the client. While the client may send 0-RTT
Protected packets after the Initial packet during 0-RTT connection
re-establishment, these can be ignored for RTT measurement purposes.

Handshake RTT can be measured by adding the client-to-observer and
observer-to-server RTT components together. This measurement necessarily
includes any transport and application layer delay at both sides.

The spin bit experiment, detailed in {{?QUIC-SPIN=I-D.ietf-quic-spin-exp}},
provides an additional method to measure intraflow per-flow RTT.  When a QUIC
flow is sending at full rate (i.e., neither application nor flow control
limited), the latency spin bit described in that document changes value once
per round-trip time (RTT). An on-path observer can observe the time difference
between edges in the spin bit signal in a single direction to measure one
sample of end-to-end RTT. Note that this measurement, as with passive RTT
measurement for TCP, includes any transport protocol delay (e.g., delayed
sending of acknowledgements) and/or application layer delay (e.g., waiting for
a request to complete). It therefore provides devices on path a good
instantaneous estimate of the RTT as experienced by the application. A simple
linear smoothing or moving minimum filter can be applied to the stream of RTT
information to get a more stable estimate.

An on-path observer that can see traffic in both directions (from client to
server and from server to client) can also use the spin bit to measure
"upstream" and "downstream" component RTT; i.e, the component of the
end-to-end RTT attributable to the paths between the observer and the server
and the observer and the client, respectively. It does this by measuring the
delay between a spin edge observed in the upstream direction and that observed
in the downstream direction, and vice versa.

Application-limited and flow-control-limited senders can have application and
transport layer delay, respectively, that are much greater than network RTT.
Therefore, the spin bit provides network latency information only when the
sender is neither application nor flow control limited. When the sender is
application-limited by periodic application traffic, where that period is
longer than the RTT, measuring the spin bit provides information about the
application period, not the RTT. Simple heuristics based on the observed data
rate per flow or changes in the RTT series can be used to reject bad RTT
samples due to application or flow control limitation.

Since the spin bit logic at each endpoint considers only samples on packets
that advance the largest packet number seen, signal generation itself is
resistant to reordering. However, reordering can cause problems at an observer
by causing spurious edge detection and therefore low RTT estimates, if
reordering occurs across a spin bit flip in the stream. This can be
probabilistically mitigated by the observer also tracking the low-order bits
of the packet number, and rejecting edges that appear out-of-order
{{?RFC4737}}.

## Packet loss measurement {#sec-loss}

All QUIC packets carry packet numbers in cleartext, and while the protocol
allows packet numbers to be skipped, skipping is not recommended in the general
case. This allows the trivial one-sided estimation of packet loss and reordering
between the sender and a given observation point ("upstream loss"). However,
since retransmissions are not identifiable as such, loss between an observation
point and the receiver ("downstream loss") cannot be reliably estimated.

## Flow symmetry measurement {#sec-symmetry}

QUIC explicitly exposes which side of a connection is a client and which side is
a server during the handshake. In addition, the symmerty of a flow (whether
primarily client-to-server, primarily server-to-client, or roughly
bidirectional, as input to basic traffic classification techniques) can be
inferred through the measurement of data rate in each direction. While QUIC
traffic is protected and ACKS may be padded, padding is not required.

# Specific Network Management Tasks

In this section, we address specific network management and measurement
techniques and how QUIC's design impacts them.

## Stateful treatment of QUIC traffic {#sec-stateful}

Stateful treatment of QUIC traffic is possible through QUIC traffic and version
identification ({{sec-identifying}}) and observation of the handshake for
connection confirmation ({{sec-confirm}}). The lack of any visible end-of-flow
signal ({{sec-teardown}}) means that this state must be purged either through
timers or through least-recently-used eviction, depending on application
requirements.

## Passive network performance measurement and troubleshooting

Limited loss measurement and detailed RTT measurement are possible by passive
observation of QUIC traffic; see {{sec-rtt}} and {{sec-loss}}.

## Server cooperation with load balancers {#sec-loadbalancing}

In the case of content distribution networking architectures including load
balancers, the connection ID provides a way for the server to signal information
about the desired treatment of a flow to the load balancers.

Server-generated Connection IDs must not encode any information other that that
needed to route packets to the appropriate backend server(s): typically the
identity of the backend server or pool of servers, if the data-center’s load
balancing system keeps "local" state of all flows itself.  Care must be
exercised to ensure that the information encoded in the Connection ID is not
sufficient to identify unique end users. Note that by encoding routing
information in the Connection ID, load balancers open up a new attack vector
that allows bad actors to direct traffic at a specific backend server or pool.
It is therefore recommended that Server-Generated Connection ID includes a
cryptographic MAC that the load balancer pool server are able to identify and
discard packets featuring an invalid MAC.

## DDoS Detection and Mitigation {#sec-ddos-dec}

Current practices in detection and mitigation of Distributed Denial of Service
(DDoS) attacks generally involve passive measurement using network flow data
{{?RFC7011}}, classification of traffic into "good" (productive) and "bad" (DoS)
flows, and filtering of these bad flows in a "scrubbing" environment. Key to
successful DDoS mitigation is efficient classification of this traffic.

Limited first-packet garbage detection as in {{sec-garbage}} and stateful
tracking of QUIC traffic as in {{sec-stateful}} above can be used in this
classification step. For traffic where the classification step did not observe a
QUIC handshake, the presence of packets carrying the same Connection ID in both
directions is a further indication of legitimate traffic. Note that these
classification techniques help only against floods of garbage traffic, not
against DDoS attacks using legitimate QUIC clients.

Note that the use of a connection ID to support connection migration renders
5-tuple based filtering insufficient, and requires more state to be maintained
by DDoS defense systems. However, it is questionable if connection migrations
needs to be supported in a DDOS attack. If the connection migration is not
visible to the network that performs the DDoS detection, an active, migrated
QUIC connection may be blocked by such a system under attack. However, a defense
system might simply rely on the fast resumption mechanism provided by QUIC. See
also https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/203

## QoS support and ECMP

\[EDITOR'S NOTE: this is a bit speculative; keep?]

QUIC does not provide any additional information on requirements on Quality of
Service (QoS) provided from the network. QUIC assumes that all packets with the
same 5-tuple {dest addr, source addr, protocol, dest port, source port} will
receive similar network treatment.  That means all stream that are multiplexed
over the same QUIC connection require the same network treatment and are handled
by the same congestion controller. If differential network treatment is desired,
multiple QUIC connections to the same server might be used, given that
establishing a new connection using 0-RTT support is cheap and fast.

QoS mechanisms in the network MAY also use the connection ID for service
differentiation, as a change of connection ID is bound to a change of address
which anyway is likely to lead to a re-route on a different path with different
network characteristics.

Given that QUIC is more tolerant of packet re-ordering than TCP (see
{{packetnumber}}), Equal-cost multi-path routing (ECMP) does not necessarily
need to be flow based.  However, 5-tuple (plus eventually connection ID if
present) matching is still beneficial for QoS given all packets are handled by
the same congestion controller.

# IANA Considerations

This document has no actions for IANA.

# Security Considerations

Supporting manageability of QUIC traffic inherently involves tradeoffs with the
confidentiality of QUIC's control information; this entire document is therefore
security-relevant.

Some of the properties of the QUIC header used in network management are
irrelevant to application-layer protocol operation and/or user privacy. For
example, packet number exposure (and echo, as proposed in this document), as
well as connection establishment exposure for 1-RTT establishment, make no
additional information about user traffic available to devices on path.

At the other extreme, supporting current traffic classification methods that
operate through the deep packet inspection (DPI) of application-layer headers
are directly antithetical to QUIC's goal to provide confidentiality to its
application-layer protocol(s); in these cases, alternatives must be found.
